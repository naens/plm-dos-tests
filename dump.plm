 *  DESCRIPTION
 *    Prints a file, the name of which is given as command line argument, on
 *    the console.  Each line corresponds to 16 bytes, the first column
 *    contain the offset of the first byte of the line from the beginning of
 *    the file, the second column contains the hexadecimal values of each
 *    byte and the third column contains the the ASCII representation of
 *    printable characters.
 * 
 *    One screen is printed at a time if the file is large.  The user can
 *    navigate using ^S for previous, ^X, space or enter for next.  By typing
